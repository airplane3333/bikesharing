Using August data, the peak ridership hours are commuting times, 7-10a.m. and 4-9p.m.

Many of the bike rides are less than an hour long and a majority of those are less 
than 10 minutes from start to finish.  This means that few bikes are need for shorter 
trips and that will keep utilization higher during peak times.

The bikes are used most frequently during the commuting times, however on the weekend 
there is a good utilization throughout the day.

## Summary
I'm not sure a comparison of bike sharing in New York City can be made with that of 
Des Moines Iowa.  In New York there is a large population of people that rely on public 
transportation, where other cities including Des Moines still use personal vehicles to 
travel around town. 

Tableau is a powerful tool to visualize large data sets. The GUI was easy to use and 
importing data from text or JSON is simple. It takes a little practice to understand how 
to represent data in the different visualization types that make it simple for the analysis 
to understand.
